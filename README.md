# House Flipper
One of my biggest interests outside of coding is real estate and house flipping. Seeing the journey of a house going from dirty and outdated to new is extremely satisfying. As it is a legitimate way to make a living, the numbers matter. Understanding how much money to put into a property to make the margin for profit reasonable is not easy as you have to simultaneously balance multiple other factors such as refraining from updating too much or spotting red flags like foundation issues. House Flipper is a desktop application built in Java using JavaFX that helps simulate the process of assessing a property and the potential it has for being a profitable flip.

# Using the App
You're an employee of a real estate company that purchases properties to repair and then resells those properties for profit. Every day you collect a list of potential homes that are worth consideration for flipping. It is your job to assess the house's condition given a list of details and determine if it is worth repairing. If it is worth repairing, you also need to determine which items are worth updating. Some items do not add value to the property. Some items add a lot of value to the property. Choosing which items to repair is important in maintaining a high profit margin.

After completing your assessment of the property and the list of items to update, either discard or commit to repairing the property for resell. After assessing a total of 5 properties, your initial assessments will be sent to your project manager for review. Your project manager will calculate the expected ARV (after repaired value) based on the comps and repairs specified, and will send you a report on your assessments.

Things to keep in mind:
- Some properties are never worth flipping (severe foundation problems or any major structural damage for example)
- Some items are never worth updating (seeding lawn for example)
